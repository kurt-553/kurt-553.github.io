## Course22 With GPU
Following on from Course22 and Brian Lovell's configuration. We can see the model run on both the CPU and the GPU with a sample batch size of 64.
### CPU
We can see just using the cpu that the process of training this model took just over 10 minutes!

### GPU
Training the same model on a GPU with a batchsize of 64 for each training dispatch, gave a result of under 30s instead of the 10 minutes of the CPU.
Amazing to see the capabilities of GPUs in clear cut results!

## t-SNE and Confusion Matrix
Training a model on a group of images scraped from DuckDuckGo search engine allowed a model classifiction of: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Dog and Cat.  
### Confusion
Confusion matrices are a great metric for the collection of error data between the classifiers of a model. We can see the results of the following categories (each scraped with close to 600 images and filtered to a smaller subset).

Some of the images with the highest confusion are given below. It's pretty clear why the ML model had trouble classifying these, a human would have a hard time too.

### t-SNE
The same model, when run with training images through t-SNE (using scikit-learn) allows for the following visualisation, showing the difference between the given groups:
